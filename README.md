# Arduino-Analogue-Computer-Interface-
I made these files for project creating direct data import/export between arduino using ultrasonic sensor and immediately process the data assuming it's a discrete data on a damped system
The data processed will be directly inputed into an alogue computer circuit and backsolve the physical damping system
